DrawingEditor
=============

Simple implemtation of a drawing editor for Windows 8.1 written in F#.
The editor lets the user draw line, circles, rectangles, Bezier courves and bouncing balls in multiple colours.

The bouncing balls can be "launched" and collide with the other shapes, bouncing accordingly.
